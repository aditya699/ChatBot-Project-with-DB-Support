      "Based on the information provided in the 5 relevant contexts, here is a summary of the key points regarding the social media policy in your organization:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Employees should get appropriate permission before referring to or posting images of current or former employees, members, vendors or suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Employees should get appropriate permission to use a third party's copyrights, copyrighted material, trademarks, service marks or other intellectual property.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Employees are not to comment on or provide information related to the organization's business or any subject matter related to their job responsibilities in public forums, unless they are specifically authorized to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Social media use should not interfere with an employee's responsibilities at the organization. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. The organization's computer systems are to be used for business purposes only. Use of social media on the company's computer systems is allowed if it is for business purposes and is authorized through the company's approval system (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, company blogs, LinkedIn). Personal use of social media on the company systems is not permitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the key aspects of the social media policy are around getting proper permissions, avoiding unauthorized disclosures about the company and its business, and limiting social media use on company systems to authorized business purposes only. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.\n"
